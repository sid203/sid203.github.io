Hi, I’m Siddhant Tandon, a Data Scientist based in Italy. I was born on the 20th of August 1994 in the liveliest city ever &mdash; Delhi, India. I pursued my engineering in Electronics & Communication in India from 2012 to 2016, a grueling set of four long years. I repeat <a href="https://youtu.be/a7RoP1LKMeM?si=laKPG2Q7txPLjJ9K&t=114" target="_blank">nothing but gruel.</a> Right after my engineering, I left home and moved to the historic city of Rome, Italy in 2016 to pursue Laurea Magistrale in Data Science from La Sapienza. I graduated in Jan, 2019 after two demanding but enjoyable years.

<p style="text-align:justify;">
So far my data science journey has been shaped by very diverse & impactful experiences. My first job as a Research Intern at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/nokiabelllabs/", target="_blank">Nokia Bell Labs</a> in Paris remains one of my fondest memories. I worked on Deep Reinforcement Learning for cloud resource management which also became my master’s thesis. Incredible work and an even more phenomenal environment.

Currently I am at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/scratch&screen/", target="_blank">Scratch&Screen</a> developing an end-to-end document intelligence system that involves OCR, document parsing, regex, computer vision, NER and building databases.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Previously, I was part of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/cgnal/", target="_blank">Cgnal</a> a small consulting firm specialized in data sciences where I built machine learning applications for clients. It was here where my love for software engineering truly began.

<p> I'd like to mention some random miscellaneous topics I came across in life that continue to spark my curiosity to this day and leave me eager to keep learning more.</p>

<ul class="list-inside list-disc" role="list">
    <li>Function Spaces — Sobolev spaces, Mercer’s Theorem</li>
    <li>Empirical Risk Minimization and Structural Risk Minimization</li>
    <li>Non parametric Bayesian Modeling</li>
    <li>PAC Learning — What sorcery are these weak estimators doing to model bias?</li>
    <li>Random Forests - Sorcery again, isn't it? but this time on model variance!</li>
    <li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
    <li>Search Engines</li>
    <li>Asynchronous Programming - The easiest way to scale apps on a budget? Really?</li>
    <li>Semaphores & Mutex</li>
    <li>Computational Graphs - How are gradients so cheaply accessible on this data structure?</li>
    <li>Python Generators - Every time you think you know them, you don’t :( </li>
    <li>Linguistics - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Mx_mW-PK3U", target="_blank"> Dr Rajpopat's work</a> on Pāṇini’s grammar proving grammar is an aritifical construct teachable to machines & it's not NLP</li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Spiegel", target="_blank">Laurie Spiegel's</a> pioneering work on electronic music - decades before "generative AI" was a buzzword</li>
</ul>
